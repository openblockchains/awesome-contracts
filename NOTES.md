stateMutability: a string with one of the following values:
- pure (specified to not read blockchain state),
- view (specified to not modify the blockchain state),
- nonpayable (function does not accept Ether - the default) and
- payable (function accepts Ether).

## ABI output formats

<https://docs.ethers.org/v5/api/utils/abi/formats/>

The supports ABI types are:

- Human-Readable ABI
- Solidity JSON ABI
- Solidity Object ABI

It is important to note that a Solidity signature fully describes all the properties the ABI requires:

- name
- type (constructor, event, function)
- inputs (types, nested structures and optionally names)
- outputs (types nested structures and optionally names)
- state mutability (for constructors and methods)
- payability (for constructors and methods)
- whether inputs are indexed (for events)



Various versions include slightly different keys and values. For example, early compilers included only a boolean "constant" to indicate mutability, while newer versions include a string "mutabilityState", which encompasses several older properties.

When creating an instance of a Fragment using a JSON ABI, it will automatically infer all legacy properties for new-age ABIs and for legacy ABIs will infer the new-age properties. All properties will be populated, so it will match the equivalent created using a Human-Readable ABI fragment.

```
 // Some examples with the struct type, we use the tuple keyword:
  // (note: the tuple keyword is optional, simply using additional
  //        parentheses accomplishes the same thing)
  // struct Person {
  //   string name;
  //   uint16 age;
  // }
  "function addPerson(tuple(string name, uint16 age) person)",
  "function addPeople(tuple(string name, uint16 age)[] person)",
  "function getPerson(uint id) view returns (tuple(string name, uint16 age))",

  "event PersonAdded(uint indexed id, tuple(string name, uint16 age) person)"
```


follow <https://docs.ethers.org/v5/api/utils/abi/fragments/#fragments--output-formats> - why? why not?

- full
- minimal
- json
- sighash
- etc.

NOTE: The sighash format is insufficient to re-create
the original Fragment, since it discards modifiers such as indexed, anonymous, stateMutability, etc.

It is only useful for computing the selector for a Fragment, and cannot be used to format an Interface.


FunctionFragmentinherits ConstructorFragmentsource
Properties
fragment.constant ⇒ boolean
This is whether the function is constant (i.e. does not change state). This is true if the state mutability is pure or view.

fragment.stateMutability ⇒ string
This is the state mutability of the constructor. It can be any of:

nonpayable
payable
pure
view
fragment.outputs ⇒ Array< ParamType >
A list of the Function output parameters.

## Ethereum Signature Database

<https://www.4byte.directory/>

> Function calls in the Ethereum Virtual Machine are specified by the first four bytes of data sent with a transaction. These 4-byte signatures are defined as the first four bytes of the Keccak hash of the canonical representation of the function signature. The database also contains mappings for event signatures. Unlike function signatures, they are defined as 32-bytes of the Keccak hash of the canonical form of the event signature. Since this is a one-way operation, it is not possible to derive the human-readable representation of the function or event from the bytes signature. This database is meant to allow mapping those bytes signatures back to their human-readable versions.
>
> There are 962,863 signatures in the database




## More


Instead, you can get the ABI from:

- Publicly available source code for the contract available from the smart contract developer, which can be used to generate an ABI.
- If the smart contract is verified on Etherscan, from the Etherscan contract information.
- Reverse-engineering the ABI from the smart contract bytecode (not recommended).
